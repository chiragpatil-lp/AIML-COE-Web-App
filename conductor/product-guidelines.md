# Product Guidelines - AIML COE Web Application

## Visual Identity & Design Aesthetic
- **Modern & Technical:** The application utilizes a clean, high-contrast design system built on **Next.js 16**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and **DaisyUI 5**.
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary:** `#f35959` (Vibrant Red) - Used for primary actions, branding highlights, and key focus areas.
  - **Neutrals:** A sophisticated range of grays (`#1a1a1a` to `#ffffff`) ensuring readability and depth.
- **Typography:** Prioritizes clarity and technical precision using **Inter** and **Plus Jakarta Sans** for body and headings, with **Geist Mono** for code and technical data.
- **Theming:** Full support for **Light** and **Dark** modes, allowing users to choose their preferred working environment while maintaining brand consistency.
- **Components:** Uses **Radix UI** primitives for accessible, high-quality interactive elements (modals, dropdowns, etc.) with consistent border radii (`0.625rem`).

## Tone of Voice & Communication
- **Authoritative & Expert:** Content should reflect the COE's position as a leader in AI/ML. Use confident, well-researched, and definitive language.
- **Technical yet Accessible:** While maintaining technical accuracy, complex concepts should be explained clearly to ensure managers and potential customers can grasp the value without being overwhelmed by jargon.
- **Professional & Precise:** Avoid fluff. Focus on delivering high-value information with clarity and purpose.

## Content Structure & Presentation
- **Hierarchical Information:** Use clear headings and structured layouts to guide users through complex pillars and case studies.
- **Rapid Consumption:** Prioritize **Quick References & Summaries** (tl;dr sections) at the top of long-form content to provide immediate value.
- **Interactive Elements:** Leverage animations (**Framer Motion**) and 3D graphics (**Three.js**) to illustrate AI/ML concepts dynamically rather than relying solely on static text.
- **Code Standards:** Technical snippets should be formatted consistently using the project's mono-space font and appropriate syntax highlighting.

## User Experience Principles
- **Efficiency First:** Design workflows that minimize clicks to reach core resources or administrative tools.
- **Responsive by Default:** Every feature must be fully functional and visually polished across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG standards to ensure the COE's resources are available to all organization employees regardless of ability.
