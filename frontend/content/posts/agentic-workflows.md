The next frontier of AI isn't just about better answers—it's about better actions. Agentic workflows are transforming how enterprises think about automation. Instead of rigid, linear scripts, we are now deploying agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously.

### From Chatbots to Do-bots

Traditional chatbots were reactive. You asked a question, and they gave an answer. Agents are proactive. You give them a goal—"Schedule a meeting with the engineering team and prepare a briefing doc"—and they handle the rest. They check calendars, find available slots, draft the agenda based on recent commits, and send the invites.

### The AgentOps Challenge

With great power comes great responsibility—and complexity. Managing a fleet of autonomous agents requires a new set of operational tools. This is where **AgentOps** comes in. It's the practice of monitoring, evaluating, and securing agent behavior in production.

Key components of our AgentOps stack include:
*   **Traceability:** Logging every step of the agent's reasoning process.
*   **Guardrails:** Enforcing strict boundaries on what actions an agent can take.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for human-in-the-loop validation to improve performance over time.

As we continue to roll out these capabilities across the Nexus platform, we invite teams to explore the potential of agentic workflows in their own domains.
