With the January 17th deadline for Investment Proof submission for Jan 2026 payroll fast approaching, we understand that navigating tax guidelines can be overwhelming. To support you during this critical filing window, the AIML Centre of Excellence (CoE) is proud to introduce **TaxMate**, an intelligent AI Tax Assistant designed to simplify your tax-related queries.

> **Note:** This tool is designed specifically to assist with **India Tax Filing** compliance and guidelines.

## What is TaxMate?

TaxMate is an internal AI assistant developed to guide Onix employees through the investment declaration process. Whether you have questions about specific tax sections or need help with file uploads, TaxMate is available 24/7 to assist.

### Key Capabilities

- **Clarify Valid Proofs:** Get instant answers on what documents are accepted for Investment Declarations (80C, 80D, etc.).
- **Specific Claims Guidance:** Ask complex queries regarding NPS, HRA, Children’s Education Allowance, and other exemptions.
- **Darwinbox Support:** Receive step-by-step guidance on upload requirements, including accepted file formats and size limits.

## Built with Vertex AI RAG Engine & Google ADK

TaxMate showcases the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in a real-world enterprise application.

### The Tech Stack

1.  **Vertex AI RAG Engine:**
    We utilized Google Cloud's fully managed RAG Engine to ground the AI's responses in our official internal tax policy documents. This ensures that every answer TaxMate provides is accurate, up-to-date, and compliant with organization-specific guidelines, minimizing the risk of "hallucinations" common in generic LLMs.

2.  **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK):**
    The application was orchestrated using the Google ADK, which allowed us to build a robust conversational agent capable of reasoning through multi-step queries. The ADK's modular framework enabled us to integrate the RAG retrieval mechanism seamlessly with the conversational flow, providing a natural and helpful user experience.

## How to Access

TaxMate is currently in **Beta** and is continuously being improved based on your feedback.
